# Grader queue
This service provides a queue system for tasks. It handles receiving tasks from
various sources and sending tasks to taskgrader servers. It was made for use
with the [taskgrader](https://github.com/France-ioi/taskgrader) but can work
with any program using JSON to describe tasks and results.

## How does it work?
* Platforms send tasks through the API `api.php`
* Grading servers poll the queue through `poll.php`
* Tasks whose tags can be handled by a given server are sent to this server
* Grading server executes the task then sends back the results through `sendresults.php`
* Platforms get the results through the API

##Â Installation
* install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and run `composer install`
* In the `www` folder, copy `config.inc.php.template` to `config.inc.php` and edit it to suit your needs.
* Execute `install.sh` in the root folder, it will set up the database and create the graderqueue certificate.
* Create keys for the platforms and the servers using `clientcert.sh` in the `certs` folder.
* Add platforms and servers to the database in the tables `platforms` and `servers`.
* Configure your web server to point to the `www` folder; for Apache2 and Nginx, you can use the example config files in the `examples` folder.
* Secure or disable access to `interface.php` with your favorite method, for instance with the `htaccess` file in the `examples` folder.

## Configuration
The file `config.inc.php` contains the database access configuration.

Once the database is set up, platforms, servers, server types and tags need to
be configured.

### Setting up a platform
Platforms send tasks through the API. They need to be registered first in the table `platforms`:
* `id` and `name` are internal identifiers (name is also the key id used in token communication)
* `public_key` is the public key of the platform (used in token communications)
* `return_url` is the url where the result of the evaluation will be sent
* `restrict_paths` means, if not empty, that the tasks sent by this platform will have access restricted to these paths during their execution
* `force_tag` means, if not `-1`, that the tag with this id will be added to all tasks sent by this platform

Platforms need to call the API with their request encoded in a token, passed in a post variable name `token`. This token ([jwt](http://jwt.io/)) has the following characteristics:

* it is encrypted (JWE) with the following parameters (all names are standard):
   * *algorithm:* `RSA-OAEP-256`
   * *encoding:* `A256CBC-HS512`
   * *compression:* `DEF`
   * *key id:* the configuration option `$CFG_key_name` of `www/config.inc.php`
* its payload is a signed token (JWS) with the following parameters:
   * *algorithm:* `RS512`
   * *key id*: the sql field `platforms.name`

The jws token can be verified with the platform public key (`platforms.public_key`) and the jwe can be decrypted with `$CFG_private_key` of `www/config.inc.php`.

Tokens used in the communication with the platform's return url are one the exact same principle.

### Setting up a server
Servers poll the graderqueue for tasks, execute them, then send back the results. They need to be registered as well in the table `servers`:
* `id` and `name` are internal identifiers
* `ssl_serial` and `ssl_dn` are the serial and issuer DN of the client SSL certificate used by the platform
* `wakeup_url` is an URL to call to wake-up the server: if this server hasn't been polling for a minute and the graderqueue has a task for it, it will call the URL
* `type` is the type of the server
* `max_concurrent_tasks` is the maximum number of concurrent tasks this server is allowed to ask for

Servers need to access the graderqueue through HTTPS, using a client SSL
certificate issued by the platform. The script `certs/clientcert.sh` easily
creates such a certificate.

### Setting up tags
Tags are capabilities of a server. If a task is assigned tags, then only
servers who can handle these tags will be given the task.

They're defined in the table `tags`; the `id` is the internal identifier, and
the `name` is the name of the tag used by platforms when sending tasks.

### Setting up server types
A server type corresponds to a set of tags: servers of this type can handle all
tags of this set (and only these tags).

Their name is defined in the table `server_types`, and the tags which can be
handled are defined with pairs in the table `type_tags`.

## API
The API at `api.php` is made for platforms to send tasks and request the
results. It needs to be access through HTTPS with a client SSL certificate, and
parameters must be sent in a POST request.

Note that the interface uses an extra parameter, `token`, allowing it to bypass
the SSL client certificate validation (thus why the interface needs to be
secured in some way).

### test
`test` request allows a platform to test the connection and authentication. No
parameters.

### sendtask
`sendtask` request allows a platform to send a task directly with the JSON data. Parameters:

* `request`: `'sendtask'`
* `taskdata`: (JSON) data of the task to be executed
* `taskname`: (string) name for the task
* `priority`: (integer) priority of the task in the queue
* `tags`: (comma-separated list of strings) tags associated with the task

### sendsolution
`sendsolution` request allows a platform to send the parameters of a task; the
JSON data of that task will in that case be generated with standard parameters
by the API. It is mainly meant for use by the interface. Parameters:

* `request`: `'sendsolution'`
* `taskname`: (string) name for the task
* `priority`: (integer) priority of the task in the queue
* `tags`: (comma-separated list of strings) tags associated with the task
* `solfile` or `solpath` or `solcontent`: solution, either as an uploaded file (`solfile`), as a path local to the grading server (`solpath`) or directly as the content of the solution (`solcontent`)
* `taskpath`: (string) path to the problem
* `memlimit`: (integer) memory limit for the execution of the solution
* `timelimit`: (integer) time limit for the execution of the solution
* `lang`: (string) language of the solution

### gettask
`gettask` requests allows a platform to fetch the status of a task. Parameters:

* `request`: `'gettask'`
* `taskid`: (integer) the ID of the task

It returns a JSON array corresponding to the contents of the table for that
task.

## Interface
Users can access a simple interface at `interface.php`; this interface allows
to send tasks, check the current status of servers and of tasks.

## Graderserver
The folder `graderserver` contains an implementation of a grading server using
this graderqueue. It was made for use with the
[taskgrader](https://github.com/France-ioi/taskgrader), but can be used with
any program accepting the task on its standard input and sending back the
results on its standard output.

Before using it, you need to edit `config.py`, using the template from
`config.py.template`, and supply the client SSL certificate for this server.

Once configured, you can execute `server.py -t` to test the connection and
authentication to the graderqueue.

To use the wake-up feature, you can for instance use `inetd`, and add a config
line to a file named `/etc/inetd.d/taskgrader` with:

    [port]   stream  tcp nowait  [user]  /path/to/server.py /path/to/server.py --server
